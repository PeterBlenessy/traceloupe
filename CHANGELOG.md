# Changelog

All notable changes to **TraceLoupe** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

While pre-1.0, the **minor** version tracks major milestones:

| Version | Milestone |
|---------|-----------|
| `0.1.0` | **MVP** — iLEAPP-powered import into a local cache, with a native browsing UI. |
| `0.2.0` | **Native lazy-decode core, wired in** — Manifest Index + on-demand decryption + native Messages/Notes/Recordings/Camera-roll parsers, running *alongside* iLEAPP (which still supplies Calls, Safari, Apps, third-party chats). |
| `0.3.0`+ | **Native-first migration, in batches** — replace iLEAPP for first-party data (Calls, Safari, Apps, self-extracted Contacts), then make iLEAPP an optional on-demand engine for third-party/long-tail apps, then native third-party modules per the roadmap. See "Planned" below. |

> The single source of truth for the version is `package.json`; keep the

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-14

The native lazy-decode core, wired into the import — plus password-protected and
pinned Notes, richer Notes browsing, and a reworked re-import UX. iLEAPP still
runs (it supplies Calls, Safari, Apps, and third-party chats); replacing it is
the batched 0.3.0+ migration under "Planned" below.

### Added
- **Native Messages, Notes, Recordings & Camera roll.** The import materializes
  these natively from the backup via a reusable `ManifestIndex` (decrypt-on-
  demand: resolve `domain/relativePath` → file + key, read one file). Messages
  come from `sms.db`; Notes from `NoteStore.sqlite` (body gzip-inflated from
  `ZICNOTEDATA.ZDATA`, text walked out of the `NoteStoreProto` wire format,
  Core Data columns schema-introspected); Recordings from `CloudRecordings.db`
  with `.m4a` streamed over a `traceloupe-audio://` scheme (Range-seekable,
  decrypted at play time). iLEAPP stays the automatic fallback when a source DB
  is absent or a native parse fails.
- **Locked (password-protected) Notes.** Detected via `ZISPASSWORDPROTECTED` /
  `ZENCRYPTEDDATA`; shown with a lock icon and unlocked on demand with the note
  password (PBKDF2 → AES-128-GCM), the plaintext held only in session, never at
  rest.
- **Notes filters & date grouping.** Filter by folder, year, and locked state;
  the list groups into Pinned + recency sections (Today, Yesterday, Previous 7/30
  Days, months, years), matching the Notes app. Parses `ZISPINNED`.
- **Re-import moved to the sidebar.** Per-data-type re-import is now an action on
  each nav item, with a spinner that survives navigation (state lifted above the
  routes); a cancelled re-import no longer destroys the previous import (atomic
  temp-cache swap).
- **Touch ID (opt-in) + signing detection.** An encrypted backup's Keychain
  password can be gated behind Touch ID; the app detects whether it's stably
  signed and enables the toggle accordingly (see `docs/signing.md`).

### Notes & caveats
- Native Messages/Notes/Recordings/Camera-roll run *in addition to* iLEAPP's
  passes, so import time isn't reduced yet — that lands with the 0.3.0
  first-party migration.
- Locked-note AES-GCM decryption and `ZISPINNED` parsing are unit-tested but
  pending validation against a real backup that contains such notes.

## Planned — 0.3.0+ (native-first migration, in batches)
- **Batch 1 (0.3.0) — first-party parity, no iLEAPP.** Native parsers for Calls
  (`CallHistory.storedata`), Safari (`History.db`), Apps (app-state plist), and
  self-extracted Contacts (`AddressBook.sqlitedb`) via the Manifest Index. Every
  built-in view then materializes natively, and the redundant iLEAPP sms/notes
  passes are dropped so import time actually falls.
- **Batch 2 (0.3.x) — iLEAPP optional.** Default install fully offline (no first-
  import download, no bundled ~222 MB engine); iLEAPP fetched on demand only when
  the user opts into deeper third-party coverage.
- **Batch 3+ (0.4.0+) — native third-party modules** per the app-tier roadmap
  (Top 10 first), replacing iLEAPP coverage incrementally. Per-app status and the
  version each gains native support are tracked in `docs/app-support.md`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-13

Initial baseline. Open, decrypt, and browse iPhone backups entirely on-device.

### Added
- Discover and open encrypted or unencrypted iPhone backups; first-time import
  via a bundled, checksum-pinned iLEAPP engine, then instant re-open from cache.
- Native, hardware-accelerated backup decryption (keybag → class keys → AES-CBC);
  camera roll read natively with on-demand full-image decryption and cache-once.
- Views: Messages (conversations, cross-conversation timeline, per-year periods),
  Photos (virtualized gallery + full-viewport lightbox with keyboard nav),
  Contacts, Calls, Safari, Notes, and installed Apps.
- Third-party chats surfaced in Messages (TikTok, WhatsApp, Telegram).
- Per-list sorting (field + direction), a 24-hour clock option, resizable and
  icon-rail sidebar, always-visible scrollbars.
- Security: key zeroization, a "forget backup" flow, `backup_id` validation, and
  hardened media serving.
