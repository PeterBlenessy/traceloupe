# Native app parser — the process

How we add native support for one more app's chat data (replacing the iLEAPP
fallback). The runnable version is the `create-native-app-parser` skill (do one
app; wrap with the built-in `/loop` to work through many); this doc is the
contributor-facing summary. **iLEAPP is the reference, not the source** (learn
schema facts, write fresh Rust — provenance: reference, architecture §10).

## Steps

0. **Scout** the iLEAPP module (`engine/iLEAPP/scripts/artifacts/<app>*.py`).
   Confirm a clean, groupable SQLite store (thread key + per-message author). Note
   from its `sample_data` which public test image has the app.
1. **Pitfall-check** — design against the checklist below *before* writing.
2. **Implement** a `parsers/apps/<app>.rs` module (`AppChatModule` + `locate` +
   `parse`), register it, reuse `col_string`/`col_i64`/`insert_app_conversation`;
   write a synthetic test (1:1 **and** a group with per-author attribution).
3. **Validate against real data** — diff native vs iLEAPP on the *same* extracted
   DB; and, once per app, extract the DB from a **public DFIR iOS test image**
   (Hickman/CTF — no need for the app in your own backup), diff, and keep a real
   fixture. Only then drop the "unvalidated" caveat.
4. **Commit.**
5. **Review** (subagent) → **fix** → **re-review** substantial fixes.
6. **Push**; cut a version when a batch (~2+ apps) is substantial.

## Known-pitfalls checklist

1. **Sender = the per-message author column**, never the conversation/group name
   (the recurring group-attribution bug). Use a stable id for `sender_id`.
2. **Timestamp epoch + unit** — Core-Data secs-since-2001 (`+978307200`) vs Unix
   s/ms/ns. Read large ints via `col_i64`, never `f64`.
3. **Direction default** for unknown/NULL state — don't attribute owner→peer.
4. **Groups named vs unnamed** — author keys off the sender column, not the group
   name; exclude system messages.
5. **Type-tolerant reads** so one odd row can't abort the parse.
6. **No JOIN fan-out** — `EXISTS`/subquery for flags, not a join.
7. **`locate` whole-path-component boundary**; exclude `-wal`/`-shm`.
8. **Decode content** — HTML→text (recover emoji `alt`), NSKeyedArchiver via
   `crate::nska`, protobuf/JSON fields.
9. **Count after commit** (the shared inserter already does this).

## Framework

`AppMessage`, `AppChatModule`, `APP_CHAT_MODULES`, `insert_app_conversation`,
`col_string`/`col_i64` — see `parsers/apps/mod.rs`. `chat_name = Some` titles the
thread and skips group inference; `None` derives from the peer / distinct senders.
iLEAPP fallback is automatic (empty parse ⇒ iLEAPP runs).
