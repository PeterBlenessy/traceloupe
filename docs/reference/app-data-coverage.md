# App data coverage

For each source we parse, this is the **living inventory** of what the backed-up
database actually contains and whether TraceLoupe surfaces it. Tick a row (⬜ →
✅) the moment a field shows up in the UI.

Companion to [`app-support.md`](app-support.md) (native vs iLEAPP per app); this
file tracks *field-level* coverage within each source.

**Legend:** ✅ surfaced · ◑ partial · ⬜ present in the backup, not surfaced ·
⊘ **won't implement** (deliberate — see below) · — not present / N/A in this backup.

> **📕 Field-level coverage is closed (v0.19.0).** Safari **local open tabs**
> (`BrowserState.db`) was the last field-level item built. **Every remaining
> `⬜` and `◑` row below is now `⊘` won't-implement** — kept in the table for
> the record, not as a backlog. The reasons, by category:
> - **Low signal in real backups** — e.g. Calls read/country-availability, Notes
>   account, Photos orientation/description, Messages filtered (11 rows), receiving
>   SIM: the field is nearly always empty or single-valued on a real device.
> - **Not authoritatively decodable** — e.g. Calls `ZDISCONNECTED_CAUSE`
>   (declined/blocked/junk): even iLEAPP only maps 2 of ~10 codes; we won't guess.
> - **Redundant** — e.g. Photos `ZMODIFICATIONDATE` (≈ the edited/added signals
>   already shown), Contacts creation/modification dates.
> - **Disproportionate effort** — e.g. Notes hashtags/tables/checklist-items and
>   Safari redirect-graph need protobuf/attribute-run or graph reconstruction.
>
> Two things are **not** covered by this closure and remain live elsewhere:
> **new stores/parsers** (e.g. iCloud-offloaded media — its own branch), and
> **per-app third-party chat** enhancements (the app-chat table below), which are
> gated on a backup that actually has the app installed.

> **Verified against a real backup (2026-07-15).** The counts below come from
> auditing the decrypted mirror of one real device: **143,088** messages ·
> **95,334** camera-roll assets · **71** contacts · **3,101** calls · **691**
> Safari history items (2,046 visits) · **3,842** notes · **606** voice
> recordings · TikTok the only third-party chat installed. "In backup" reflects
> the observed schema and can vary by iOS version. All parser defects found in
> this pass, including locked-note decryption, have been fixed — see
> [Known parser defects](#known-parser-defects).

## Messages (iMessage / SMS) — `sms.db`

The parser is deliberately minimal — it selects only `text, is_from_me, date,
handle_id, cache_has_attachments` — so the entire rich-interaction layer of
iMessage is unsurfaced.

| Data | In backup | Surfaced | Notes |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Message text (`text`) | ✅ 133k | ✅ | Plaintext only |
| Rich text (`attributedBody`) | ✅ 142k | ✅ | Decoded — recovers the body of text-less messages (streamtyped NSString extractor, validated 3000/3000 vs the `text` column). Styling/mentions not surfaced (plain text) |
| Timestamp (sent) | ✅ | ✅ | `date` |
| Read / delivered receipts | ✅ 100k / 63k | ✅ | `date_read`/`date_delivered` → a "Read <time>" / "Delivered" line under sent bubbles (the `is_read/error` flags remain unused) |
| Edited messages | ✅ 897 edits | ✅ | `date_edited` → an "Edited" tag on the bubble (current text shown). Full per-edit version history (`message_summary_info`) not decoded |
| Unsent / retracted | — 0 | — | Empty in this backup |
| Direction + sender handle | ✅ | ✅ | `is_from_me`, `handle.id` (contact-resolved) |
| Receiving line (`destination_caller_id`) | ✅ 143k | ⬜ | Which SIM/account received it — dropped |
| Service (iMessage/SMS) | ✅ 140k / 3.4k | ✅ | Per-thread; service filter + brand icon |
| Attachments (image/video/file) | ✅ 8,558 | ✅ | filename, mime, on-demand decrypt/serve |
| Attachment size / dimensions / `transfer_state` | ✅ | ⬜ | Not surfaced — can't flag not-downloaded attachments |
| `is_sticker` | ✅ 641 | ✅ (0.18.0) | Sticker attachments → content kind `sticker`, lighting up the (previously dead) Stickers filter pill; 616 text-less sticker messages classify here |
| Thread / conversation | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Group name + participants | ✅ 84/85 | ✅ | `display_name`, `chat_handle_join` |
| Group actions (rename/join/leave) | ✅ 544 | ✅ (0.15.0) | `item_type` 1–4 rendered as centered system rows ("‹actor› ‹action›") |
| Tapbacks / reactions (+ custom emoji) | ✅ 7,600 / 478 | ✅ | `associated_message_type`/`_guid`/`_emoji` folded (add/remove, per reactor) into a per-message "❤️×2 👍" badge; the tapback rows are no longer shown as messages |
| Replies (inline threads) | ✅ 6,560 | ✅ | `thread_originator_guid` resolved (via the GUID map) to a quoted preview above the reply bubble |
| Expressive effects | ✅ 217 | ✅ (0.18.0) | `expressive_send_style_id` → "Sent with Confetti/Slam/…" label under the bubble (208 messages, 12 effect types) |
| App/bubble messages (Apple Cash, polls…) | ✅ 589 | ⬜ | `balloon_bundle_id` / `payload_data` not decoded |
| Filtered (unknown sender) / archived | ✅ 11 | ⬜ | `chat.is_filtered` — no Unknown/Filtered separation |
| Recently-deleted / recoverable | ✅ 54 | ✅ (0.18.0) | `chat_recoverable_message_join` (not in `chat_message_join`) UNIONed into the parse; deleted messages surface in-thread with a red "Deleted &lt;date&gt;" badge — 54 recovered here |
| Content kind (media/text/link/sticker) | derived | ✅ | `messages.kind` → content-filter pills |

## Notes — `NoteStore.sqlite`

Everything lives in one Core Data table (`ZICCLOUDSYNCINGOBJECT`); only the
plain-text protobuf body layer is decoded.

| Data | In backup | Surfaced | Notes |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Title | ✅ 3,837 | ✅ | `ZTITLE1` |
| Body text | ✅ | ✅ | gzip-protobuf decoded; **plain text only** — bold/lists/links/attachment runs dropped |
| Snippet | ✅ | ✅ | `ZSNIPPET`, first-line fallback |
| Folder | ✅ 97 | ✅ | incl. "Recently Deleted" |
| Created date | ✅ 3,837 | ◑ | **Fixed this pass** — was mapped to all-NULL `ZCREATIONDATE1`; now COALESCEs to `ZCREATIONDATE3`. Stored in cache; not yet shown in UI |
| Modified date | ✅ | ✅ | Drives all recency grouping/sort/time-filter |
| Pinned | ✅ 349 | ✅ | |
| Locked (flag + withhold body) | ✅ 9 | ✅ | Lock icon, filter, password prompt |
| **Locked-note unlock (decrypt body)** | ✅ | ✅ | On-demand: user enters the note password in-app → PBKDF2 → AES-key-unwrap → AES-128-GCM. Never decrypted at rest |
| Password hint | ✅ | ✅ | none present on the 9 locked notes here |
| Embedded images / scans / drawings | ✅ 505 notes | ✅ (0.15.0) | Counts as badges + every image in a detail gallery (`note_media` table); true inline-at-position rendering still future work |
| Checklists (structured) | ✅ 46 | ◑ | `ZHASCHECKLIST` → a checklist badge on the note; item text/checked-state (protobuf attribute runs) not decoded |
| Tables | ✅ 18 notes | ◑ | Counted in the attachment badge (`com.apple.notes.table`); cells not decoded |
| Hashtags / mentions | ✅ 273 | ⬜ | Inline attribute runs |
| Shared / collaboration | ✅ 24 shared / 70 participants | ⬜ | Share state + participants dropped |
| Account / source | ✅ (1 iCloud) | ⬜ | |

## Calls — `CallHistory.storedata`

Parser extracts 6 of ~45 `ZCALLRECORD` columns.

| Data | In backup | Surfaced | Notes |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Address (number / handle) | ✅ 3,096 | ✅ | |
| Timestamp / duration / direction / answered | ✅ | ✅ | `ZDATE`/`ZDURATION`/`ZORIGINATED`; drives "missed" |
| Service (phone/FaceTime) | ✅ | ✅ | coarse (`ZSERVICE_PROVIDER`) |
| FaceTime video vs audio | ✅ (315 audio / 710 video) | ✅ | `ZCALLTYPE` → "FaceTime Video/Audio" label; only video gets the video icon |
| Location | ✅ 2,848/3,101 | ✅ | `ZLOCATION` → shown in the call row subtitle |
| Country code | ✅ 2,082 | ✅ (0.18.x) | `ZISO_COUNTRY_CODE` → a flag emoji on the call row (2,060 se, plus us/dk/it here) |
| Read / new-missed flag | ✅ | ⬜ | `ZREAD` — no unseen-missed badge |
| Withheld / unavailable number | ✅ 5 | ⬜ | `ZNUMBER_AVAILABILITY` |
| Disconnect cause / filtered reason | ✅ | ⬜ | declined/blocked/junk not distinguished |
| Contact name on call (`ZNAME`) | — 0 | — | Empty here; UI resolves via Contacts |
| Unique id (`ZUNIQUE_ID`) | ✅ | ⬜ | No dedupe key — re-import clears + reinserts |
| Group-call / participant UUIDs | ✅ | ⬜ | FaceTime-group linkage unused |

> UI caveat: the "Name" sort actually sorts by raw `address`, not the resolved
> contact name shown in the row.

## Safari — `History.db` / `Bookmarks.db` / `SafariTabs.db`

| Data | In backup | Surfaced | Notes |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| History URL / per-visit title / visit time | ✅ 691 items / 2,046 visits | ✅ | searchable, time-filtered, sortable |
| Total visit count | ✅ | ✅ | sort-by-visits |
| Redirect chains | ✅ 92 links | ⬜ | `redirect_source/destination` — navigation graph not reconstructed |
| Deleted-history tombstones | ✅ 2,477 | ✅ | `history_tombstones` → surfaced in the History list flagged `deleted` (trash icon + strikethrough, "Deleted" instead of a visit time) |
| Load status / HTTP method / origin / score | ✅ | ⬜ | Not parsed |
| Daily/weekly visit-count blobs | ✅ | ⬜ | Visit-time histogram unused |
| Bookmarks (title/url) | ✅ 8 | ✅ | + open external |
| Bookmark folder hierarchy | ✅ | ◑ | Only immediate parent shown; no tree/breadcrumb |
| Reading list (title/url/added/preview) | ✅ 1 | ✅ | |
| Reading-list last-viewed | ✅ | ✅ (0.15.0) | "Read ‹date›" or an "Unread" badge on each reading-list row |
| Reading-list unread/fetched flags | ✅ | ⬜ | No read/unread indicator |
| Open tabs (title/url) | ✅ 41 | ✅ | + tab group name |
| Open tabs (local) + private-browsing | ✅ 201 tabs | ✅ (0.19.0) | `BrowserState.db` `tabs` replaces the thinner iCloud `SafariTabs.db` (44) as the Tabs source: per-tab last-viewed + a **Private** badge (`private_browsing`; 0 private here but wired). Window/tab-group grouping + recently-closed left as ⊘ |

## Contacts — `AddressBook.sqlitedb`

Parser reads only First/Last/Organization + phone/email multivalues (hardcoded to
properties 3 & 4).

| Data | In backup | Surfaced | Notes |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| First / last name | ✅ | ✅ | drives sort |
| Organization | — 0 here | ✅ (capable) | parsed + shown; none populated |
| Middle name / nickname | — 0 here | ✅ | parsed + shown in detail; none populated in this backup |
| Prefix / suffix / phonetic | — 0 here | ⬜ | not parsed |
| Job title / department | — 0 here | ✅ | parsed + shown ("Work" section); none populated here |
| Phone numbers (+ labels) | ✅ 77 | ✅ | tel: links; also feeds message matching |
| Emails (+ labels) | ✅ 11 | ✅ | mailto: |
| Postal addresses | ✅ 6 | ✅ | `ABMultiValueEntry` (Street/City/State/ZIP/Country) → one-line address, shown with its label |
| Social / IM handles | ✅ 1 | ⬜ | property 46 |
| Related names (relationship graph) | ✅ 24 | ✅ (0.16.0) | Property 23 → "Related" detail section (label = relationship, magic labels cleaned, custom kept) |
| Birthday | ✅ 11 | ✅ | `Birthday` Core Data timestamp → shown in detail |
| Contact note | ✅ 22 | ✅ | shown in the detail "Note" section |
| Groups + membership | ✅ 3 / 40 | ✅ (0.16.0) | `ABGroup` ⋈ `ABGroupMembers` → "Groups" chips in the detail |
| Photo | ✅ 54 | ✅ | thumbnail w/ full-size fallback |
| Memoji / avatar recipe | ✅ | ⬜ | |
| Creation / modification dates | ✅ 71/71 | ⬜ | present on all; unused |
| Identity (`guid`/`ExternalUUID`, `PersonLink`, account) | ✅ | ⬜ | linked/unified contacts not modeled — may show as duplicates |

## Voice recordings — `CloudRecordings.db`

| Data | In backup | Surfaced | Notes |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Title | ✅ 606 | ✅ | **Fixed this pass** — now reads `ZENCRYPTEDTITLE` (plaintext locally, all 606 rows) instead of falling back to the timestamp label for the ~330 memos without a composition manifest |
| Composition-manifest title | ✅ 276 | ✅ | `.composition/manifest.plist` `RCSavedRecordingTitle` (preferred when present) |
| Recorded-at date / duration | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Audio playback (`.m4a`) | ✅ | ✅ | Range-seekable, decrypt-on-demand |
| Folder | ✅ 245/606, 8 folders | ✅ | `ZFOLDER.ZENCRYPTEDNAME` joined via the recording's `ZFOLDER` FK; shown in the row subtitle + detail |
| Recently-deleted (`ZEVICTIONDATE`) | ✅ (0 set) | ⬜ | A trashed memo would show as normal |
| Playback position / studio-mix flags | ✅ (0 set) | ⬜ | minor |
| Transcript / favorite / geo | — | — | Not present in this DB (source limitation, not a parser gap) |

## Camera roll — `Photos.sqlite`

`camera_roll.rs` enumerates DCIM files + capture date; `photos_meta.rs` enriches
people/GPS/favorite/moment/albums onto `media_items`.

| Data | In backup | Surfaced | Notes |
|------|:---------:|:--------:|-------|
| Photo / video file + thumbnail | ✅ 88k / 7.1k | ✅ | full-res + thumb, decrypt-on-demand |
| Capture date | ✅ | ✅ | primary sort + time filter |
| Added / modified dates | ✅ | ◑ | `ZADDEDDATE` → lightbox "Added &lt;date&gt;" when it differs from capture by >1 day (received/saved/imported media; 1,174 here). `ZMODIFICATIONDATE` still unread |
| GPS lat/long | ✅ 24k | ✅ | lightbox Maps link (no map/grid pin) |
| Reverse-geocoded place | ◑ | ◑ | moment/event title only; per-asset reverse-geocode blob ignored |
| **EXIF** (camera, lens, ISO, exposure, focal length) | ✅ 22–25k | ✅ | `ZEXTENDEDATTRIBUTES` → camera + lens + "ISO · ƒ · shutter · mm" in the lightbox |
| Dimensions / file size | ✅ 95k | ✅ | `ZWIDTH`/`ZHEIGHT` + `ZORIGINALFILESIZE`; shown in the lightbox |
| Orientation | ⬜ 95k | ⬜ | `ZORIENTATION` unread |
| Albums — user | ✅ 482 | ✅ | lightbox chip + search |
| Albums — smart/system | ⬜ 235 | ⬜ | excluded (`ZKIND=2` only) |
| Favorite | ✅ 17k | ✅ | heart badge + search |
| Hidden | ✅ 46k | ✅ | `ZHIDDEN` → an eye-off badge on the grid tile + lightbox (shown, not excluded — forensic) |
| Recently-deleted / trashed | ✅ 48 | ✅ (0.18.0) | `ZTRASHEDSTATE`/`ZTRASHEDDATE` → red trash badge on the grid tile + lightbox indicator (shown, not excluded — forensic, like Hidden). Not yet a standalone filter category |
| Faces / people (named) | ✅ 69 named / 72k faces | ✅ | badge + lightbox + search (named only) |
| Live Photo / burst | 374 / 53 | ✅ (0.18.0) | Live Photo = `ZPLAYBACKSTYLE=3`, burst = shared `ZAVALANCHEUUID` → grid badges (circle-dot / stacked). Full burst-group *stacking* still future work |
| Subtype — screenshot (~65k), panorama (45) | ✅ | ✅ | screenshot = `ZISDETECTEDSCREENSHOT` (`ZKINDSUBTYPE=10` corroborates); panorama = `ZKINDSUBTYPE=1` (**fixed 0.18.0** — was wrongly `=2`, which is a Live Photo's still frame, so 381 Live Photos were mislabeled "panorama"). HDR/portrait/slo-mo codes left unclassified (ambiguous) |
| Video duration | ✅ 7.1k | ✅ | `ZDURATION` → `media_items.duration_s` |
| Description | ⬜ 1,253 | ⬜ | `ZASSETDESCRIPTION` unread |
| Edited-vs-original / import session / cloud state | ⬜ 17k edited | ⬜ | provenance + edit state unread |

## Third-party app chats

Native modules under `parsers/apps/` feed a shared pipeline. **In this backup only
TikTok is installed**; the other ten rows reflect the parser's SELECT + the
iLEAPP-derived schema in code comments (unvalidated).

**App-chat attachment media — framework landed (0.10.0-dev).** The shared inserter
now has `insert_app_conversation_with_media`: an `AppMessage` carries
`AppAttachment`s, and the import driver passes a resolver that maps each to a
backup blob (by basename, via the Manifest) — inserting an `attachments` row and
mirroring image/video into `media_items` (source = the app), exactly like
iMessage. A message whose media isn't in the backup still records the attachment
metadata. **Remaining:** individual parsers must *emit* `AppAttachment`s from
their media tables (WhatsApp `ZMEDIALOCALPATH`, Kik `ZKIKATTACHMENT`, Threema
`ZFILENAME`, TikTok `TIMFileORM`) — deferred until a backup with that app's media
is available to validate against (this backup has none: TikTok's media files
aren't backed up, and no other chat app is installed).

| App | DB present here? | Surfaced | Notable available-but-unsurfaced | Media |
|-----|:---:|------|------|:---:|
| WhatsApp | — | text, ts, direction, chat name, has-attachment | media path; **group per-msg author** (inbound mis-attributed to partner); calls | ⬜ |
| Messenger | — | text, ts, direction, sender, chat key | media, reactions | ⬜ |
| Instagram | — | text, ts, direction, sender | all media (`has_attachment` hardcoded false), reactions | — |
| **TikTok** | ✅ | text, ts, direction, sender name/handle, **kind** (text/shared/sticker/system) | `TIMFileORM` (317 rows: local path + remoteURL + mime + md5); group members/name; read receipts | ⬜ (typed marker only) |
| Telegram | — | text, ts, direction, chat/author name, has-attachment | media, reactions, reply/forward | ⬜ |
| Kik | — | text, ts, direction, chat name, has-attachment | media; group sender left blank | ⬜ |
| imo | — | text, ts, direction, sender (per-author) | `ZIMDATA` payload, phone | ⬜ |
| Threema | — | text/caption, ts, direction, sender (per-author) | media files incl. `ZFILENAME` | ⬜ |
| Viber | — | text, ts, direction, sender (per-author) | attachments, calls, location, time-bomb | ⬜ |
| Teams | — | text (HTML→plain), ts, direction, sender (per-author) | attachments (`has_attachment` hardcoded false) | — |
| LinkedIn | — | text, ts, direction, chat/sender name | attachments, InMail/reaction metadata | — |

Other cross-cutting gaps: **reactions/starred/edited** aren't modeled anywhere
(no cache column exists); **group per-message sender** is missing for WhatsApp &
Kik; **call history** from WhatsApp/Viber/Teams is unparsed (the `calls` table is
iMessage/phone-only); **contacts/social graph** is imported only for TikTok
(`source='TikTok'`). Only WhatsApp and TikTok are marked validated in code.

## Untouched data (present in backup, not surfaced)

TraceLoupe surfaces most of the backup's high-value data — Messages, Photos,
Contacts, Calls, Safari, Notes, Recordings, third-party chats, installed apps,
Health, CoreDuet Interactions, Calendar, Reminders, and device metadata (the ✅
rows below). The remaining rows exist in this backup but have no parser yet,
ranked by value × feasibility.

| Domain | Present here? | Rough scale | Value | Notes |
|--------|:---:|-------|:---:|-------|
| **Health** | ✅ **rings + mobility + timezones (0.17.0)** | 344,063 quantity samples, 13 workouts, 24k GPS points, 1,137 ring days, 10 timezones | ★★★ | **Health** view sections: workout log with inline GPS-route previews, daily-activity table (steps/distance/flights/energy + HR + activity rings vs goals + walking/audio metrics), sleep sessions, and a per-timezone travel timeline from `data_provenances.tz_name`. Remaining: per-sample browsing (raw quantity samples). Achievements (Awards) and symptoms (Cycle Tracking) now shipped; stand-hours (`appleStandHour`, cat 70) is absent from this backup |
| **CoreDuet interactions** | ✅ **surfaced (0.10.0-dev; channels 0.18.0-dev)** | 15,055 interactions, 66 contacts, 12 apps | ★★★ | **Interactions** view: pre-aggregated `ZCONTACTS` per-person graph (name/handle · incoming/outgoing counts · first–last span), most-contacted first, plus a per-app **Channels** strip from the raw `ZINTERACTIONS` table (`ZBUNDLEID`/`ZDIRECTION`) — which apps the interactions flowed through, with in/out totals |
| **Device / backup metadata** | ✅ **surfaced (0.10.0-dev)** | name, model, iOS version, serial, last-backup, encryption | ★★★ | New **Device** view: `device_info` command re-reads Info.plist via the stored `source_dir`; model id mapped to a marketing name |
| **Calendar** | ✅ **surfaced (0.10.0-dev)** | `Calendar.sqlitedb` 217 events, 15 calendars | ★★ | New **Calendar** view: title/when/location/notes + calendar name (`CalendarItem` entity_type 2, joined to `Calendar` + `Location`). Invitees/recurrence not yet parsed |
| **Reminders** | ✅ **surfaced (0.10.0-dev)** | 124 reminders | ★★ | New **Reminders** view: title/notes/due/completion/flag + list name (`ZREMCDREMINDER` joined to `ZREMCDBASELIST`; trashed excluded) |
| **Apps view metadata** | ✅ available | Info.plist `Applications` → version, install/purchase date, seller | ★★ | cache stores only `bundle_id`; no version/date/size/name shown |
| **Keychain** | ✅ (sensitive) | passwords / Wi-Fi / certs | ★★ | surface presence + counts only, never values |
| **Instagram time-in-app** | ✅ partial | 7 usage DBs | ★ | usage telemetry only, no messages |
| **Maps** | store empty | favorites/history/visits all 0 | ★ | ideal schema, nothing synced locally here |
| **Podcasts / Journal / Wallet** | empty/absent | 0 rows | ★ | apps present but unused in this backup |
| **Freeform** | present, corrupt | `boards.db` "disk image malformed" | ★ | WAL-only in backup; not usable as-is |
| **Mail** | no store here | only prefs + Gmail autocomplete contacts | ★ | no Envelope Index in this backup |
| **Screen Time (knowledgeC)** | absent | — | — | not in this backup (only CoreDuet) |

**Highest-value additions** (all since shipped): Health (workouts 0.10.0; daily
activity, sleep and GPS routes 0.16.0), the CoreDuet interaction graph, and
Calendar/Reminders — all hold substantial real data, are plain SQLite with
documented schemas, and need no new decryption path. A **Device Info** view was
almost free (the data was already extracted and thrown away). Keychain should be
presence-and-counts only. Maps/Podcasts/Journal/Wallet are worth a parser for the
schema but render empty on this particular device.

## Known parser defects

Found while auditing against the real backup (2026-07-15):

1. **Notes — locked-note decryption** ✅ *(fixed this pass)*. The parser read the
   note ciphertext from a nonexistent `ZENCRYPTEDDATA` column (real ciphertext is
   `ZICNOTEDATA.ZDATA`) and took the AES-GCM IV/tag from the object row instead of
   `ZICNOTEDATA`; it also ignored `ZCRYPTOWRAPPEDKEY`, so the ladder was missing
   the AES-key-unwrap step. Now: ciphertext + IV/tag from `ZICNOTEDATA`,
   salt/iterations/wrapped-key from the object row, cached alongside the note
   (schema v24), and `unlockNote` runs the full ladder (PBKDF2 → RFC-3394 unwrap →
   AES-128-GCM) on demand when the user enters the note password in-app. Handles
   this device's anomalous variant (iterations 0 → 20000 default; 16-byte wrapped
   key) by trying multiple key candidates and letting the GCM tag authenticate the
   right one. Pending: end-to-end confirmation with a real note password.
2. **Notes — creation date lost** ✅ *(fixed this pass)*. `col_or_null` picked the
   first *existing* date column; on a modern NoteStore `ZCREATIONDATE1` exists but
   is all-NULL while the value is in `ZCREATIONDATE3`. Now COALESCEs across all
   that exist so a populated sibling wins.
3. **Recordings — real titles ignored** ✅ *(fixed this pass)*. The parser used the
   timestamp-only `ZCUSTOMLABEL`, so the ~330 memos without a `.composition`
   manifest showed as bare timestamps. Now prefers `ZENCRYPTEDTITLE` (plaintext
   locally, populated on all 606 rows).
4. **Calls — "Name" sort** sorts by raw `address`, not the resolved contact name
   shown in each row (cosmetic ordering mismatch).
